Here's a detailed explanation for your **Resume Builder App** setup, using the **MERN stack**, including commands and emojis for clarity:

---

### 1. **Start the Server (Backend)** 🖥️

The backend of your **Resume Builder App** is built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It handles all server-side logic, including login/signup authentication and saving user data.

1. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   node server
   ```
   - 🔧 **`node server`**: This command starts your Node.js backend server. It typically listens on a specific port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`), where it handles API calls for login, signup, and saving user data related to resume creation.

### 2. **Navigate to the Client (Frontend)** ⚛️

The frontend of your **Resume Builder App** is built using **React**. Users can create resumes by selecting various templates after logging in.

1. **Navigate to the client directory:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
   - 📂 **`cd client`**: This moves you into the `client` folder, which contains your React code for building the user interface.

### 3. **Start the Client (Frontend)** 🚀

The frontend allows users to interact with the app, including selecting templates, entering personal data, and viewing resume previews.

1. **Run the React development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - 🚀 **`npm start`**: This command starts the React app in development mode, allowing you to view your resume builder in the browser. Live reloading is enabled, meaning any changes you make will automatically refresh the page.
